# Presentation
- Present the project, the data, the methods you used, the main development steps.

## Abstract
Binary Classification for two separate datasets:
- Kidney Diseases
- Banknote Authentification

The first dataset will be used to compute coefficients to predict the presence of a kidney disease given some other datas.

The second dataset has for purpose to give some variables to predict the authenticy of banknotes.

### Kidney Disease dataset
Describe variables and methods

### Banknote Authentification dataset
Describe variables and methods
Compare precisions,...

# Comments about results
- Show and comment your results
Compare precisions,...

# Good Programming practices
- Include one part describing what you think are good programming practices

Divide main task in several small tasks and signalize the steps by TODO comment (usually highlited in IDEs).

Comment the code for better understanding by other programmers when doing a collaborative project/ for a program that will be maintained by others.
- Put examples

# Appendix
- In appendix, provide the logs of your git repository and your code.

Nice code
